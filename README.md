# NexaLibrium - Library Management System

Created by Taylor Rupe & Caleb Kasprzyk

## NexaLibrium is a powerful and intuitive library management system built using Next.js, a popular React framework for server-side rendering and building modern web applications. This project aims to streamline library operations by providing a user-friendly interface for managing books, authors, and their relationships.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** NexaLibrium leverages Next.js server actions to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for most tables. This allows the DB manager to easily manage the library's collection and keep the records up to date.

- **Seamless UI/UX:** The application offers a smooth and intuitive user experience, thanks to the use of ShadCN-UI components. These pre-built UI components provide a sleek and consistent design, enhancing the overall look and feel of the system.

- **Database:** NexaLibrium utilizes a PostgreSQL database provided by Vercel to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- **Deployed on Vercel:** The project is hosted on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.

## Getting Started

To run NexaLibrium locally or deploy it to your own environment, follow these steps:

## Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the database connection configuration in the project.

## Start the development server:

`npm run dev`

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access NexaLibrium.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web apps.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **ShadCN-UI:** A collection of beautifully designed and accessible UI components for React applications.
- **Aceternity-UI** Beautiful animated components for our homepage.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful and open-source relational database management system.
- **Vercel:** A cloud platform for deploying static sites and serverless functions.

## Acknowledgements

This project was bootstrapped with create-next-app to provide a starting boilerplate for a nextjs application. By adapting UI components from SHADCN and consulting the NextJs documentation we were able to implement our UI and CRUD operations.
